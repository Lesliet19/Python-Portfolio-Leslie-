Website to display all my python projects

i want to be able to upload my projects from the website not from the pyhton code and html and all that

- Create Database to store project details : Project name, Description, Pictures Etc.
-  Create Flask Form to get The project details

only want admin to be able to add, delete and edit Porject uploads
- i can either do log in and authentication
or
- can just create a 'secret' app route which gives me access to those abilities
   - this way it's not as secure but it does save time, and then later on i can add those features if i want.
